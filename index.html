            How I Met Your Mother is a comedy about Ted and how he fell in love. It all starts when Ted's best friend, 
            <br>
            Marshall, drops the bombshell that he's going to propose to his long-time girlfriend, Lily, a kindergarten 
            <br>
            teacher. At that moment, Ted realizes that he had better get a move on if he too hopes to find true love.

        The Witcher is not a person, but rather a profession. To put it simply, they're monster hunters. The Continent, the land 
        <br>
        where the Witcher takes place, has a variety of beasts and ghouls. Some notable examples include the walking spirit of a 
        <br>
        forest called the leshen that's made up of plants, animal pelts and skulls, and the bruxa, a powerful female vampire who has a deafening scream. 
        <br>
        Witchers are trained to dispose of these monsters using a variety of tools and weapons at their disposal. Their most useful is their silver 
        <br>
        swords because the metal is usually the most effective against unholy beasts. They also have a selection of simple magic spells called Signs 
        <br>
        that can be cast using a particular sign with their hands. Two commonly used are the telekinetic push Aard and the fire spell Igni. 
        <br>
        Witchers can use Signs quickly in a battle at the expense of a bit of their own endurance. 
        <br>
        One of the most important Witcher tools is a silver medallion. These magical neckpieces vibrate when monsters are nearby or if magic is 
        <br>
        being used, which makes them invaluable to a monster hunter.

            Detective Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is a good enough cop that he's never had to work that hard or follow the rules too closely. 
            <br>
            Perhaps because he has the best arrest record among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged - throughout his entire 
            <br>
            career. That is, until the precinct gets a new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt (Andre Braugher ), who reminds this hotshot cop to respect the badge.
